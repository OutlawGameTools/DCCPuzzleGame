# DCC The Puzzle Game
DCC The Puzzle game is a grid-based "delete matching tiles" type of game made with Unity.

Daphne, Doris, Danny, and Pete dropped out of their apprenticeships the night before their graduation. Why? To start the best dungeon janitorial service in the kingdom!

In Dungeon Cleaning Crew: The Puzzle Game, your job is to clear at least half of the loot from each level so you can continue to go deeper into the dungeon.

This is not the entire game, just the Unity C# scripts. Maybe something I wrote coud help you in whatever game you're creating.

You can download the iOS game (free) from the App Store: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dungeon-cleaning-crew-puzzle/id1071224061?mt=8
